<details>

A language should have some way of expressing all of these ideas. Each preposition could probably have its own chapter in a grammar textbook.

- "at" (the basic locative preposition) - "on/upon" can be merged with this.
- "of" (possessive)
- "to" (the basic allative preposition)
- "from" (the basic allative preposition)
- "in"
- "with" (comitative)
- "with" (instrumental)
- "by" (agentive) - can be merged with "with"
- "by" (limitative of time, e.g. "by 5:00")
- "for" (dative) - can be merged with "to"
- "during"
- "per" / "for each"
- "like" / "as"
- "without"

### Less Common Prepositions

- "between"
- "after"
- "about" / "concerning"
- "next to" / "beside"
- "in front of" / "before"
- "after" / "behind"
- "touching"
- "under"
- "over"
- "near"
- "out of"
- "through" / "via"
- "according to"
- "because of"
- "for want of"
- "instead of"
- "for the benefit of"
- "against" / "for the detriment of"

### Notes

Prepositions "to" and "from", and variants like "onto" and "from out of" can be replaced by inchoative and cessastive inflections of other prepositions. E.g. "to" can be `at#INCHO`. "for" (dative) can be `of#INCHO`.
