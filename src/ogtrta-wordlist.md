<details>

A language should have some way of expressing all of these ideas. Each preposition could probably have its own chapter in a grammar textbook.

- `at1` or `LOC1` "at" (the basic locative preposition) - "on/upon" can be merged with this.
- `of1` or `GEN1` "of" (genitive)
- `to1` or `ALL1` "to" (the basic allative preposition)
- `from1` or `ABL1` "from" (the basic ablative preposition)
- `in1` or `INESS1` "in" (the basic inessive preposition)
- `COM1` "with" (comitative)
- `INS1` "with" (instrumental)
- `AGT1` "by" (agentive) - can be merged with "with"
- `LIM1` "by" (limitative of time, e.g. "by 5:00")
- `DAT1` "for" (dative) - can be merged with "to"
- `during1` "during"
- `DISTR1` "per" / "for each"
- `CMPR1` "like" / "as"
- `PRIV1` "without"

### Less Common Prepositions

- `between1` "between"
- `touch1` "touching"
- "about" / "concerning" - can be merged with "touching"
- `beside1` "next to" / "beside"
- `before1` "in front of" / "before"
- `behind1` "after" / "behind"
- `under1` "under"
- `over1` "over"
- `near1` "near"
- `ELA1` "out of" (elative)

- "according to"
- "because of"
- "for want of"

### Notes

Prepositions "to" and "from", and variants like "onto" and "from out of" can be replaced by inchoative and cessastive inflections of other prepositions. E.g. "to" can be `at1#INCH`. "for" (dative) can be `of1#INCH`.
