# Lexical Structure

In natural languages, words for abstractions usually derive from words for concretions. You can follow an artificial version of this derivation process when creating your language. Create translations for the "evocative words" below first. If you're feeling ambitious (or indecisive), create _two_ translations for each word. Then, when you need an "infrastructure" word for a translation, you can steal one of the "evocative" words.

### Personal Pronouns

_I, they, he, she, it, thou, you, we_

### Correlatives

As far as I know, the term _correlative_ comes from Esperanto. It's not a linguistics term. Correlatives include the pronouns, demonstratives, adverbs, and quantifiers that can be arranged in a neat table like so (Esperanto's table of correlatives):

|                | What X  | That X | Some X | All X | No X |
| -------------- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ---- |
| Demonstrative pronoun | **kio** "what" | **tio** "that" | **io** "something" | **cxio** "everything" | **nenio** "nothing" |
| Demonstrative determiner | **kiu** "who, which X" | **tiu** "that person, that X" | **iu** "someone, some X" | **cxiu** "everyone, all X" | **neniu** "no one, no X" |
| Kind of, sort of | **kia** "what kind of" | **tia** "that kind of" | **ia** "some kind of" | **cxia** "every kind of" | **nenia** "no kind of" |
| Reason | **kial** "why" | **tial** "therefore" | **ial** "for some reason" | **cxial** "for all reasons" | **nenial** "for no reason" |
| Time | **kiam** "when" | **tiam** "then" | **iam** "at some time, once" | **cxiam** "always" | **neniam** "never"
| Place | **kie** "where" | **tie** "there" | **ie** "somewhere" | **cxie** "everywhere" | **nenie** "nowhere" |
| Motion | **kien** "whither" | **tien** "thither" | **ien** "(to) somewhere" | **cxien** "(to) everywhere" | **nenien** "(to) nowhere" |
| Manner | **kiel** "how" | **tiel** "thus" | **iel** "somehow" | **cxiel** "in every way" | **neniel** "in no way" |
| Possessive | **kies** "whose" | **ties** "that one's" | **ies** "someone's" | **cxies** "everyone's" | **nenies** "no one's" |
| Amount | **kiom** "how much" | **tiom** "that much" | **iom** "some" | **cxiom** "all" | **neniom** "none" |

Your table need not be regularized the way Esperanto's is. You might have more or fewer rows or columns. Conspicuously absent from the Esperanto table is a proximal/distal distinctionâ€”e.g. there's a regular word for _then_, but not _now_. To form the proximal demonstratives _this, here_, Esperanto prefixes **cxi**, e.g. **cxi tie** "here"... but _now_ is **nun**. Such _suppletive_ forms for correlatives are common in natural languages.

Esperanto uses **kiu** in sentences like **Kiu hundo mordis vin** "Which dog bit you?", but standing alone, **kiu** means "who". Your language might use different words for these meanings.

### Numerals

_zero, one, two, three, four..._

_first, second, third..._

_half, third, quarter..._

_once, twice, thrice..._

## Boring Verbs

_be, have, do, say, go, make_

### Modal Verbs

_will, can, may, might, should, must_

English uses modal verbs to express _intent_ (will, shall), _certainty or uncertainty_ (will, might), _ability_ (can) _permission_ (may), and _obligation_ (should, must). Your language might merge some of these, or distinguish finer shades of meaning. These meanings don't have to be expressed by separate verbs, either! You could use particles, or affixes on the main verb.

## Common Adverbs

_out, up, down, back, only, well, just, even, again, away, off, too, much, though, yet_

## Verbs of Perception and Cognition

_see, look, watch_

_hear, listen_

_know, believe, think_

_remember, recall_

_seem_

## Verbs of Speaking

_say, speak, tell, ask, answer_

## Verbs of Motion

_go, come, put, get, take, bring, give_

_turn, move_

## Verbs of Desire

_like, want, need, love, wish, try_
