Musings on lexical structure

## Purpose

Suppose you're creating a conlang. Which words should you create first, and how do you come up with interesting example sentences?
This repository aims to answer those questions.

The naive approach—"translate whatever sentence strikes your fancy, and make up new words for anything not in your dictionary"—is unlikely to produce a coherent whole. The vocabularies of real languages aren't randomly generated, and they don't all have the same structure as English.
Words are built from other words, and are defined by the borders they share with their neighbors in semantic space.

Approaching word creation in a more systematic way can be daunting. These resources might make it easier.
